# Climate Gateway Torizon Base Image

This is our customized base image for the Climate Gatway.
We adjusted the follwing:

- Suitable Device Tree for Ivy Board
- TailScale for remote SSH connections

## Build & Deploy

To build and deploy you can use our bespoke scripts, which will make use of the torizon-core-builder.
This is a way more flexible and versatile approach than working with the tcb plugin and the Toradex scripts...
